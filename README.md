# Geese 🐦

> "Geese fly in formation, helping each other navigate — Geese, the app, does the same for your team."

**Geese** is a local-first, collaborative tool for teams to manage projects and API workflows efficiently. Inspired by the teamwork of geese, it brings together an API client, real-time project boards, and AI-powered productivity features so your team can move in sync.

## 🚀 Vision

Geese is designed to be lightweight, flexible, and offline-first for developers and teams. It combines:

- **API Client:** Test and debug REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket APIs seamlessly.
- **Project & Feature Boards:** Organize tasks, features, and flows (like Trello/Notion).
- **AI-Assisted Descriptions:** Instantly generate notes or summaries for features.
- **Voice-to-Text Support:** Quickly add descriptions or comments using your voice.
- **Team Collaboration:** Start with LAN/local network access, with future plans for lightweight sync and member snapshots.

## 💡 Why “Geese”?

Geese fly in V-formations to conserve energy and navigate efficiently together. This app helps teams work together just as efficiently—sharing knowledge, tracking progress, and staying in sync, even when working locally.

## 🌱 Roadmap

- **MVP:** Local API client, project boards, and AI-assisted descriptions
- **Phase 2:** Local network team sync and lightweight snapshots
- **Phase 3:** Offline-first cloud sync and advanced AI collaboration features
